    Display welcome message:
        "Your mission: Destroy all Klingon ships before Stardate (START_DATE + MISSION_DURATION)."

    Generate galaxy map:
        For each of the 8 rows (x) and 8 columns (y):
            Assign Klingons:
                - Generate random float r between 0 and 1
                - If r > 0.98 → 3 Klingons
                - Else if r > 0.95 → 2 Klingons
                - Else if r > 0.80 → 1 Klingon
                - Else 0 Klingons
                Add this count to KLINGONS_REMAINING

            Assign starbases:
                - Generate random float r between 0 and 1
                - If r > 0.96 → 1 starbase
                Increment STARBASES_REMAINING if added

            Assign stars:
                - STARS = 1 + random integer 0–7

        Ensure at least one starbase exists:
            If STARBASES_REMAINING = 0:
                Add a starbase to the Enterprise's starting quadrant

    Populate initial quadrant:
        - Place Enterprise in assigned sector
        - For each Klingon:
            1. Find an empty sector (random search until empty found)
            2. Assign Klingon shields = KLINGON_SHIELD_STRENGTH_BASE * (0.5 + random float 0–1)
        - For each starbase:
            Find empty sector and place starbase
        - For each star:
            Find empty sector and place star
